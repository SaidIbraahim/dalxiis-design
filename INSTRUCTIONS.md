## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **Database Relationships**
- `bookings` references `tour_packages` and `destinations` (optional)
- `profiles` manages user authentication and roles
- Financial tables are independent for reporting flexibility

### **Public Pages Architecture**
- **Static Pages**: Home, About, Contact, Services (no database required)
- **Dynamic Pages**: Packages, Destinations (CMS-driven content)
- **Interactive**: Booking form (submits to `bookings` table)

### **Admin Access Control**
- Role-based access: `superadmin`, `admin`
- Admin users restricted to dashboard only
- Public users see all public pages

### **Data Flow**
1. Admin creates/updates packages and destinations via CMS
2. Public pages display dynamic content from database
3. Customers submit bookings via public form
4. Admins manage bookings, financial data, and generate reports

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

4. **Develop Financial Management** - Enhanced financial operations

### **Development Guidelines**
- Use existing database schema (no more table changes needed)
- Leverage existing UI components where possible
- Maintain consistent design patterns
- Ensure responsive design for all sections
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### **Testing Requirements**
- Test all CRUD operations for each section
- Verify data relationships and constraints
- Test responsive design on various devices
- Validate admin role restrictions
- Test public page content updates
