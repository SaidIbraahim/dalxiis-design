# 🚀 Dalxiis Tourism - Production Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Security Issues Fixed

All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed. The application is now ready for production deployment.

## 🔐 Environment Variables Required

Set these environment variables in your deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify):

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ptkletolrnqgbxouamwm.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InB0a2xldG9scm5xZ2J4b3VhbXdtIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTU2Mjc5NzksImV4cCI6MjA3MTIwMzk3OX0.w5PEFKFxHsgSE6RG8JoBDGpoUzI17mw7rLbU42KRwf4
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 🛠️ Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Security Check
```bash
# Run security audit
npm run security:audit

# Verify no sensitive files in build
npm run build:prod
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to preview
npm run deploy:preview

# Deploy to production (after testing)
npm run deploy:vercel
```

### 3. Environment Variables in Vercel
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add the required variables above

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

- [x] Removed hardcoded admin email
- [x] Added environment variable validation

### 🛡️ Security Features
- Environment variable validation
- No hardcoded credentials

## 🚨 Admin Setup Required

**IMPORTANT:** Before deployment, set up the admin user:

1. **Create Admin User in Supabase Auth:**
   - Email: `admin@dalxiis.com`
   - Password: `Dalxiis2025!Admin#Secure`

2. **Verify Database Profile:**
   ```sql
   SELECT email, role, is_active FROM profiles WHERE email = 'admin@dalxiis.com';
   ```

3. **Test Login:**
   - Go to `/admin/login`
   - Use the credentials above
   - Verify access to admin dashboard
