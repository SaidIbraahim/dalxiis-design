Dalxiis Tourism – Website Requirements
 General Overview
Dalxiis Tourism requires a dynamic and fully manageable website that empowers their internal team
(admins) to edit, update, delete, or add content without developer assistance. The website should
showcase their services, promote local destinations, and make it easy for clients to explore and book
tour packages.
 Website Objectives
Full Admin Control: The Dalxiis team should be able to update every section of the website,
including tour packages, services, destinations, images, contact info, and more — all without
developer input.
Explore & Book Travel Packages:
Offer clearly categorized packages: Basic and VIP.
Each package should include:
Package name (localized, e.g., Garowe to Bosaso Package)
Price
Details on what's included: Tickets, Accommodation, Meals, Activities, etc.
Highlights of places covered (e.g., Biyo Kuleele, Mareera Beach).
Packages should be filterable by destination — users can select their route (e.g., Garowe
to Eyl), and view tailored packages.
Once a user selects a package and submits the booking form, they should immediately
receive confirmation and a prompt to connect directly with Dalxiis staff via WhatsApp.
 Services Offered
Dalxiis Tourism operates primarily in Puntland, Somalia, with service coverage in cities such as Garowe,
Bosaso, and Galkaio. Their offerings include:
Airport Pickup & Drop-off:
Users should fill in relevant details (e.g., airport, arrival time, city, etc.).
Form data should be accessible only to Dalxiis staff for secure client assistance.
Accommodation Booking:
Clients can browse partner hotels in a selected city.
Booking is done through Dalxiis on behalf of the customer.
All submitted information should be securely stored and accessible to Dalxiis admins.
